# RacingAngularGame
![alt text](https://github.com/qinyi2000/RaceGame/blob/master/Pic.PNG)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

## Source
This project was based on a project from [this website](https://www.codershood.info/2018/03/02/building-2d-racing-game-using-angular/)

## Changes I made based on the original project
* I added coins to the original project. Coins will flash across the screen just as car obstacles would; if the driver touches the coin, the coin will disappear
* I added pause/resume button; the text of the button will change dynamically depending on status of the game

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
